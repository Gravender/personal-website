When you’re bitshifting a number in javascript it converts the number to a 32bit signed integer from a 64 bit floating point number.
After the action is complete it converts it back to a 64 bit floating point number. This itself is not a problem but it can cause some unexpected results.
If you’re bitshifting a number that is larger than 32 bits it will be converted to a 32 bit number and you will lose the bits that are larger than 32 bits causing bugs in your code.

## Solution

To avoid this problem you can use Big Ints to store the number. This will allow you to bitshift a number that is larger than 32 bits without losing any bits.
However, you will need to convert the number back to a 64 bit floating point number after the bitshift is complete if you want the build in javascript Math functions.
